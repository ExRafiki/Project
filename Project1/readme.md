<span style="color:red">##GA PROJECT NUMBER 1:</span>

###Goal:

Make a fun game that can be played more then once (mainly as a time killer).
To create a functional game that has a clean code as DRY as i can manage.
Focusing on a scalable game so it can be upgraded as the course goes on.
User friendly and interactive

###Languages used:

* HTML5
* Vanilla JS / Jquery
* CSS

###Released on

* Github

##Game - BATTLEFIND

The point of the game is to find the hidden ships in the grid.Limited clicks make
it so that a high score can only be achieved if correct guesses are made consistently.

##Process

###Research

I started with searching all basic games available on Appstore or small game websites.
While searching , i found out that battleship has been done over and over , but following the traditional
concept which is player 1 and player 2 fighting each other.I could not find a game
that had the RNG(RandomNumberGeneration) factor to it which adds re-playability.

###Development

* 1 -Using other battleship game structures i set up a general javascript structure that
game a certain logic to the concept.
* 2 -Working slowing on the game logic i set up ship generation then added the horizontal/
vertical.
* 3 -Spend 2 days figuring the array positioning as well as making it "true" RNG so
no one pattern is the same

###Lessons learned:

*  Focus on core structures and more my way up the problem rather then try to fix
it all at once.
*  Consistent use of console log to locate the issue as well as see how the FUNCTIONS
are running.

###Challenges

*  Original functions layout as well as the use of 2D array using random generation.
*  Google Chrome Dev tools - not displaying the changing in value of the grid-item's data-ship,
making me waste a lot of time trying to change the data-attribute.
*  The refactoring so the game can be played ''forever''.
*  Time management , as i didn't have time to focus on aesthetics.

###Goals achieved

- [x]Make a fun game that can be played more then once (mainly as a time killer).
- [x]To create a functional game that has a clean code as DRY as i can manage.
- [x]Focusing on a scalable game so it can be upgraded as the course goes on.
- [ ] <span style="color:red">User friendly and interactive text/animation</span>

###Future Features

* The future idea that i would like to be implement would be :instructions, fade
 in , single player or online, leaderboard and finally animation to make it more
 interactive.
